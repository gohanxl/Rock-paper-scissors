# Rock-paper-scissors
Rock, paper, scissors game!
I'm learning JavaScript, and I decided to do a simple game, that ended up being this complete mess that actually works!
I spent like 10 hours doing this, #worth.

Special thanks to freeCodeCamp.org video for guiding me through this, I changed some stuff here and there, that's it!
